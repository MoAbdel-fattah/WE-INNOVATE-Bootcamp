# **Privilege Escalation**

**Privilege escalation** is a critical technique in cybersecurity that involves gaining elevated access to a system, often from a limited user account to a privileged one like root or administrator. This allows attackers to execute commands with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the entire system.

## **Common Techniques**

### 1. **Exploiting System Vulnerabilities:**  
   * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.  
   * **Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities:** Specific vulnerabilities in software or operating systems that directly elevate privileges.  
### 2. **Password Cracking:**  
   * **Brute Force:** Trying every possible combination of characters.  
   * **Dictionary Attacks:** Using a list of common passwords.  
   * **Rainbow Tables:** Precomputed tables of hashed passwords.  
### 3. **Credential Theft:**  
   * **Keyloggers:** Record keystrokes to capture passwords.  
   * **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing credentials.  
   * **Credential Dumping:** Extracting stored credentials from memory or files.  
### 4. **Exploiting Weak Configurations:**  
   * **Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords.  
   * **Misconfigured Services:** Services running with excessive privileges.  
   * **Weak Permissions:** Files or directories with incorrect permissions.  
### 5. **Lateral Movement:**  
   * **Pass-the-Hash:** Using a stolen hash to authenticate to other systems.  
   * **Token Stealing:** Capturing a user's authentication token to impersonate them.

## **Examples Of Privilege escalation**

### **Linux:**

* **Sudo Vulnerability:** If a user can execute a command with `sudo` and the command can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, privilege escalation is possible.  
* **Weak `sudoers` File:** Incorrectly configured `sudoers` files can grant excessive privileges.  
* **Exploiting Setuid/Setgid Programs:** Programs that run with elevated privileges can be exploited if they have vulnerabilities.

### **Windows:**

* **UAC Bypass:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in User Account Control (UAC) to elevate privileges.  
* **Exploiting Services:** Services running with high privileges can be targeted for exploitation.  
* **Token Stealing:** Capturing a high-privilege token to impersonate the user.

## **Mitigation Strategies**

* **Regular Patching:** Keep systems up-to-date with the latest security patches.  
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords.  
* **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant users only the minimum necessary privileges.  
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities.  
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about security best practices.
